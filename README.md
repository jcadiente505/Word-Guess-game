# Word-Guess-game

Here is my attempt at a vanilla JS hangman game!
I found this challenge to be the most difficult so far, unfortunately
there were some errors in the code that I could not reconcile before due date.
However this assignment really helped me understand some core concepts in JS.
having first hand experience with things like conditional statements and scope especially!


The Hangman game has a movie theme that prints 3 different character names from movies,
the names are hidden by underscores.
you have 10 lives to guess the correct letters! once you guess a correct letter
the letter reveals itself changing from underscore too the letter pressed
if you guess all letters correct before your lives run out you win!
your win counter goes up and the game resets

if you guess wrong, the wrong letters appear in the wrong box. Guess more than 10 wrong letters
and unfortunately you lose and the game resets with your losses counter going up as well

Thank you! Sorry for the bugs and I hope you enjoy!!
