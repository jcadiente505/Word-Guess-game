If you would like to contribute! Here is where there are issues

1) The letter function does not properly clear and often leads too correct words already being stored when the game restarts
2) the win counter goes up by how many correct letters there are

Some Guidelines!

1) I ask that you keep one main function that calls the others, in this case that function is moviebtn
2) I ask that this be coded using only vanilla JS and not JQuery or others

Thanks again!
